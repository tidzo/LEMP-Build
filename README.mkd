This package represents a script to install the latest NginX, MySQL and PHP (with APC and Suhosin):

  * NginX 1.0.3 stable
  * PHP 5.3.6
  * APC 3.1.9
  * Suhosin Extension 0.9.32.1

All the steps are described at http://vladgh.com/blog/install-nginx-and-php-php-fpm-mysql-and-apc.  Many thanks to Vlad for his work so far.
It's highly recommended to run this installer on a fresh installed system.
This is tested with Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04, both 32 bits and 64 bits, on official Amazon EC2 Ubuntu images.

# HOW TO: #

Make sure you have Git installed on your Ubuntu System:

    sudo apt-get install git-core screen

Clone this repository, and get the latest stable version of this script:

    git clone git://github.com/vladgh/VladGh.com-LEMP.git
    cd VladGh.com-LEMP

Run the installer; I recommend running everything inside a screen session because if your connection drops you can easily come back with `screen -rad`

    sudo screen bash install.sh

If you need an earlier version checkout the appropriate tag before running the install script:
  
    git checkout 2.3

After the installer is finished (this will take a long time depending on your server specifications), you can go to your servers address and you will see the PHP info page.
Also, if you go to:

  * **http://example.com/apc.php** you will find the APC Cache information page;
  * **http://example.com/nginx_status** for the NginX statistics;
  * **http://example.com/status?html** for the FPM statistics.
